This is a one-dimensional tic-tac-toe. The board consists of a row of 20 spaces. There are two players. The first player (the user) makes a move by entering a number and placing an x into the board. After player 1 has made their move, player 2 (the computer) places an o. The current status of the board is displayed after every move.

In case one player has three characters in a row, theres a winner. In case neither player 1 or 2 have three characters in a row, there's a draw. The game continues until there's either a winner or a draw.
